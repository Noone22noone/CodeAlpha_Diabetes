# CodeAlpha Diabetes ‚Äì Machine Learning Prediction

This project applies several machine learning classifiers to predict diabetes based on patient health data.  
It compares the performance of classic models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) and boosting (XGBoost).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (linear kernel)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

Each model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, with metrics including:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes features such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

(Target variable: Diabetes outcome)
